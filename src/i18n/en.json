    "title": "About Me",
    "p1": "I've been in the software game for about 5 years now, working at places like Amazon and Meta. Originally from Lima, Peru. Studied Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, but ended up going the self-taught route into software.",
    "p2": "I'm a generalist. Scaling problems, latency issues, product decisions. I go where the problems are and figure it out.",
    "p3": "Outside of work, I spend time helping new grads and college students with career growth, sharing everything I've learned throughout my time in tech. If I can help someone skip a few of the mistakes I made, that's a win.",
    "p4": "When I'm not working, you'll probably find me traveling somewhere new or playing ping pong.",
